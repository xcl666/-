# Build guide

Connect Elite-C to computer and flash "kolibri_default.hex" firmware using qmk toolbox

Solder diodes for all keys. Black stripe on diode to square pad on pcb

Solder Elite-C to top side of pcb. Check that pins match. Cut off the excess legs. 
I suggest wearing eye protection and placing something to top of Elite-C when cutting excess legs. Those legs will fly.

Add rotary encoder (optional)

Add stabilizers 5x2U, pcb foam and FR4 plate. Check that pcb foam sits nicely and is top of gasket "wings". Place switches and solder them.

Solder rgb strip (optional). Check that strip is correct way (din on strip matches din text on pcb). Add soldering iron to rgb strip pins and holes at pcb. Place them closely and heat up to connect them

## Case

Put screws from the bottom and add standoffs.

Add legs. I suggest using double sided tape rather than screws for better flex clearance.

Add case layers 2-4 and place gasket strips. Leave out middle strip if you prefer more flex

Add soldered pcb. There's ~0.5mm clearance between outer sides of pcb and inner sides of case. Use your time to place the pcb so it doesn't hit side of case.

Add rest of the case layers 5-7 and screw it in.
