The case is kept similarly to the Arisu case:

- sandwich mount
- 6 layers of 3mm material (plus 2 feet layers for angle)

## Miscellaneous

> How do I get a layered case?

For a low profile case: Download the `lopro.dxf` file and upload it to a laser cutting service.  
For a high profile case: Download both the `lopro.dxf` and the `hipro_addon.dxf` files and upload both to a laser cutting service.  
Depending on the service you choose you might be able to save some money if you move the parts around so they fit in a better sheet size.

> How do I edit the case files?

If you just want to rearrange the layers I recommend using Inkscape to move the pieces to the desired positions.  
I altered the original files by importing them into Fusion 360, so I included these files for you to work on as well.
