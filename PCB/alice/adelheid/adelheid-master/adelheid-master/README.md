The Adelheid is a 75% Alice-like keyboard.  
It's a fork of FateNozomi's Arisu files: [Arisu PCB](https://github.com/FateNozomi/arisu-pcb) &amp; [Arisu case](https://github.com/FateNozomi/arisu-case)

## Miscellaneous

> Why?

I think accessing the function keys with a layer on the number row is the superior method as it's faster and more comfortable because you barely have to move your hands. I found myself trying to access the function row one-handedly quite often and nothing beats the comfort of pressing a single dedicated key. By default you can still access the function keys via the number row on the secondary layer.

> Where does the name Adelheid come from?

I thought it'd be nice to continue the somewhat tradition of naming Alice-clones by putting a spin on the forename Alice, just like the Arisu, Lisa and Majbritt did. I chose Adelheid as a German spin on the name.  
The typeface is called Fraktur and was the dominant typeface during the time when Adelheid was one of the most popular names.

> Will you add more keys to the bottom row or a second B key?

I don't plan on changing the bottom row or adding a second B key. In my opinion the keyboard looks the best and most balanced the way Fate designed it.

## TODO's

- add 3d printable case files
